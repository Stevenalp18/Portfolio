Hey Reader,

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio.

This is my personal website with my own personal domain and soon-to-be portfolio with my projects listed.

I am a self taught web developer and am pursuing to become a full-time web developer within the next year or so.

I plan on making a portfolio that shows who I am and what I can do with my skills.

The languages I am familiar with are, but not limited to:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

As of 6/20, this is all that I know but plan on learning more on my own.

I am going based on the FreeCodeCamp.org curriculum and highly recommend it to those who wish to learn to code.

Anyway, thank you for reading this and enjoy!

Also, if you are an employer, hi there :) Hope I have what you are looking for.
